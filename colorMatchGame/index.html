    <h1>The Color Match Game</h1>
    <p>LetÂ´s play guessing the color match. When you will click over a box It will reveal the real color.
      In that moment, You have to drag the box to the place that you think you can find the match. 
      If it is a color match, both of them will keep open showing the real color. If it is not a Color
      match, both of them will back to black. At the end, you can see how long took you finish the game
